# Minimal Requirements Generator

This script extracts only the necessary third-party packages used in your Python project and generates a clean `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions.

## Usage

1. Place `extract_requirements.py` in your project directory.
2. Modify the `SRC_DIR` variable in the script to point to your code.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python extract_requirements.py
```
